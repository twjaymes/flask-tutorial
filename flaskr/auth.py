import functools

'''
This creates a Blueprint named 'auth'. Like the application object, the blueprint needs to know where it’s defined, so __name__ is passed as the second argument. The url_prefix will be prepended to all the URLs associated with the blueprint.
'''

from flask import (
    Blueprint, flash, g, redirect, render_template, request, session, url_for
)
from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash, generate_password_hash

from flaskr.db import get_db

bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth')

'''
The @bp.route decorator associates the URL /register with the register view function. When a request is made to /auth/register, Flask calls this view and uses its return value as the response.

If the form is submitted (request.method == 'POST'), the input is validated. request.form maps submitted form keys and values, allowing the user to input their username and password. Ensure these fields are not empty.

Upon successful validation, the new user data is inserted into the database using db.execute with SQL queries. Passwords are securely hashed with generate_password_hash() before being stored. db.commit() saves the changes. If the username already exists, an sqlite3.IntegrityError is raised and shown to the user.

After storing the user, they are redirected to the login page using url_for() and redirect(). If validation fails, the error is shown using flash().

If the user navigates to /auth/register or there was a validation error, an HTML page with the registration form is rendered using render_template().

    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        db = get_db()
        error = None

        if not username:
            error = 'Username is required.'
        elif not password:
            error = 'Password is required.'

        if error is None:
            try:
                db.execute(
                    "INSERT INTO user (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)",
                    (username, generate_password_hash(password)),
                )
                db.commit()
            except db.IntegrityError:
                error = f"User {username} is already registered."
            else:

        flash(error)

    return render_template('auth/register.html')


'''


    The user is queried first and stored in a variable for later use.

    fetchone() returns one row from the query. If the query returned no results, it returns None. Later, fetchall() will be used, which returns a list of all results.

    check_password_hash() hashes the submitted password in the same way as the stored hash and securely compares them. If they match, the password is valid.

    session is a dict that stores data across requests. When validation succeeds, the user’s id is stored in a new session. The data is stored in a cookie that is sent to the browser, and the browser then sends it back with subsequent requests. Flask securely signs the data so that it can’t be tampered with.

'''
bp.before_app_request() registers a function that runs before the view function, no matter what URL is requested. load_logged_in_user checks if a user id is stored in the session and gets that user’s data from the database, storing it on g.user, which lasts for the length of the request. If there is no user id, or if the id doesn’t exist, g.user will be None.
